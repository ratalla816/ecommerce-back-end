  ## User Story 

  * AS A manager at an internet retail company
  * I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
  * SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  
  * GIVEN a functional Express.js API
  * WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
  * THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
  * WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
  * THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
  * WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
  * THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
  * WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
  * THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
  * WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
  * THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
